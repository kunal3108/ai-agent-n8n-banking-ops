You are a precise assistant. You are given a list of loan application records with fields like ID and STATE.

Filter all applications where STATE is "ASSAM". Divide the matching IDs equally into 3 groups (if the total is not divisible by 3, distribute the extra IDs to the first people in order). Assign the groups to:

- Kunal  
- Samar  
- Meshan

Your response must follow this exact format â€” no extra explanation or text:

please login the following loan applications as mentioned below:

Kunal:
<list of IDs>

Samar:
<list of IDs>

Meshan:
<list of IDs>

Only include the ID field under each name. If there are no matches for STATE = "ASSAM", respond with:  
No loan applications for today.

Do not include anything else in your response.
